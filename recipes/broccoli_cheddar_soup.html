        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 cups broccoli florets (fresh or frozen)</li>
            <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream (or milk)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sauté the Aromatics: In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent,
                 about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Cook the Broccoli: Add the broccoli florets and broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 
                10-15 minutes until the broccoli is tender.</li>
            <li>Thicken the Soup: In a small bowl, whisk the flour with a bit of the broth from the pot until smooth. Stir this mixture
                 back into the soup to thicken it. Let it simmer for another 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add Cheese and Cream: Stir in the heavy cream and shredded cheddar cheese until melted and smooth.</li>
            <li>Serve: Ladle the soup into bowls and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
