            Hashbrowns are a popular breakfast dish made from grated or shredded potatoes that are pan-fried until golden brown and crispy. 
            They have a savory, slightly salty flavor and a crunchy texture on the outside, with a soft, tender interior. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep the Potatoes: Peel the potatoes and grate them using a box grater or food processor.</li>
            <li>Rinse and Drain: Rinse the grated potatoes under cold water to remove excess starch, then drain well. 
                Squeeze out as much moisture as possible using a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.</li>
            <li>Mix Ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the grated potatoes, cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Form Patties: Shape the potato mixture into small, flat patties, about the size of a palm. </li>
            <li>Heat the Oil: In a large skillet, heat about 1/4 inch of vegetable oil over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Fry the Hashbrowns: Once the oil is hot, carefully add the patties to the skillet, frying a few 
                at a time without overcrowding. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side until golden brown and crispy.</li>
            <li>Drain and Serve: Remove the hashbrowns from the skillet and drain on paper towels. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
